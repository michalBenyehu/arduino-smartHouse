# arduino-smartHouse
Arduino project implementing working with sensors of ULTRASONIC, LEDS, FAN, LCD, Humidity/Temperature

# Hardware
1. Arduino Uno - a must
2. ULTRASONIC
3. LEDS
4. FAN
5. LCD
6. Humidity/Temperature

all the devices except the Arduino are optional

# Software
downoad the Arduino IDE

# Code files 
Smart_house.ino

* for each device you add, download the required package directory

upload the file to arduino - the upload command in the arduino IDE will also compile the file.
